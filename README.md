# Korean-Drama

It is no more secret that I love "Korean Drama"! 

When I first started learning SQL, I thought that a good way to learn would be to practice in something that I was interested at.

Why not explore list of "Korean Drama"?

There are so many k-drama's released every year, having different rating rate and streamed on various on Network belonging to different genre, with different stories. 

I created this two tables from scratch, to practice some basic SQL skills.

Feel free to copy and paste and practice yourself. I hope you enjoy it!

I also put the results in Tableau. Check it out: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/melissa8342/viz/KoreanDramaListasof2022/Koreandramalistasof2022
